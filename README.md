 <strong>Hello there, I am a Software Engineer, at heart I'm an artist who weirdly likes math (when she behaves). I love videogames, I love sports, I love movies, cars, computers, music, books, anime, clothes, etc. I code in mostly but not limited to JavaScript, Python, and C++. As I add projects I try to be as thorough as possible, adding comments and spacing stuff well, all that good stuff. This profile is not a niche one, I will and always will do projects in any area, from Robotics to AI to a Flappy Bird clone!</strong>
